Data Collection:
- Used Etherscan API to fetch all normal transactions for each wallet address.
- (For production, use Compound-specific contract events for more precise protocol activity.)

Feature Selection:
- num_txns: Total number of transactions (proxy for activity/experience).
- avg_value: Average value per transaction (not directly used in score, but available for further analysis).
- failed_txns: Number of failed transactions (proxy for risky/failed actions).
- unique_contracts: Number of unique contracts interacted with (proxy for protocol diversity).

Scoring Method:
- Features are normalized across all wallets.
- Score = 1000 * (0.5 * norm_txns + 0.3 * norm_failed + 0.2 * norm_unique)
- Lower number of txns and unique contracts, and higher failed txns, increase risk (lower score).
- Score is clipped to [0, 1000].

Justification:
- More active wallets with diverse protocol interactions and fewer failed txns are considered lower risk.
- The model is simple, interpretable, and can be extended with more protocol-specific features.
